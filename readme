 EXPERIMENT 3: Image Sampling and Quantization

Objective
To perform image sampling and quantization on a grayscale image using Python, OpenCV,
and NumPy.
Theory

1. Image Sampling
• Definition: Sampling refers to selecting discrete pixel points to represent a digital
image in spatial coordinates (x, y).
• Concept: When we reduce the sampling rate (i.e., reduce the number of pixels), the
image resolution decreases, leading to a loss in detail.
• Example: Reducing an image from 512×512 pixels to 128×128 pixels will make it
appear pixelated.

2. Image Quantization
• Definition: Quantization refers to reducing the number of gray levels (intensity levels)
in an image.
• Concept: In an 8-bit grayscale image, each pixel has intensity values ranging from 0
to 255 (256 gray levels). By reducing this range to fewer levels (for example, 16 or
32), tonal details are lost, but memory usage decreases.
• Example:
o 8-bit image → 256 gray levels
o 4-bit image → 16 gray levels

3. Thresholding (Binary Quantization)
• Thresholding is a special case of quantization where the image is converted into two
gray levels — black (0) and white (255).
• A threshold value is chosen (e.g., 100). Pixels with intensity below the threshold are
set to black, and those above are set to white.

Algorithm
1. Import necessary libraries (cv2, numpy, matplotlib if needed).
2. Load the input image in grayscale mode using cv2.imread().
3. Apply thresholding using cv2.threshold() to perform binary quantization.
4. Display the original and quantized (binary) images using cv2.imshow().
5. Wait for a key press and then close all image windows.

Python Code:





import cv2
# Read the image in grayscale
img = cv2.imread("C:/Users/Surjit/OneDrive/Desktop/my.jpeg",
cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
# Apply threshold value 120
ret, binary = cv2.threshold(img, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
# Show the result
cv2.imshow("Original Image", img)
cv2.imshow("Binary Image (Threshold=100)", binary)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
